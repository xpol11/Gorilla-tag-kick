PATCHED FINDING NEW WAY TO DO IT




I found out a new and better way to kick and crash people in gorilla tag. the kick should work all the time but the crasher has like 50% chance of working. 
I didnt use plugins/mods to bypass the anticheat. Iv tried multible time to make one with a DLL But it never worked or it just got you banned. 
This new way is a lot more faster.


**HOW TO USE**
step 1. open gorilla tag
step 2. open the gorilla tag kick
step 3. go into a private or public session      (You wont get banned in public but i would still be careful)
step 4. Walk up to the player that you want to crash
step 5. put your hand on any body part 
step 5. Click trigger (right controller )and grip on your controller

Once you have did that the player should now be kicked

Now if you want to crash them do this.
